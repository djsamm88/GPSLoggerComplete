A lightweight, battery efficient GPS Logger. The purpose of this app is to log your GPS coordinates at specified intervals to a file on your SD card.  This app runs in the background so that you can on a long walk, hike, flight ride or photo session or even go buy some milk and have this running as long as possible.   Once you're back at your computer, you can then use the files to geotag photos, upload to travel sites, view in Google Earth and so on.

<b>Notes</b>

A data connection is used by this app only if you use auto send features or Custom URL features

Although the app allows 0 second frequencies, it is not recommended as the recording and logging is happening very fast; this could cause instability/hangs. Try 1-3 seconds instead.
